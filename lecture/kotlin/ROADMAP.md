# 🏁 Kotlin Vibe Coding: The Agentic Way

Welcome to the **Kotlin Vibe Coding** track.
This isn't just a tutorial on Kotlin syntax. It's a meta-course on **how to teach an AI to be a Kotlin Expert**.

By the end of this course, you will have extended the MoAI-ADK framework to support Kotlin as a first-class citizen.
