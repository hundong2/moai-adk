# Chapter 05: Capstone - Building a Service

## 🏔️ The Final Challenge

You have the **Environment**, the **Brain**, the **Agent**, and the **Loop**.
Now, let's put it all together to build something real.

**Goal**: Build a **Weather API Service** using Ktor.

## 📜 The Spec

Create a `specs/weather-service.md`:

```markdown
# SPEC-001: Weather API
Build a Ktor service with:
1. `GET /weather/{city}`: Returns mocked weather data (JSON).
2. `POST /weather`: Allows adding new data.
3. Use Clean Architecture (Service -> Repository -> Domain).
4. Full Test Coverage.
```

## 🏗️ The Execution

1.  **Plan**: `/moai:plan "Build the Weather API based on SPEC-001"`
2.  **Run**: `/moai:alfred "Implement SPEC-001 using expert-kotlin"`
    - Watch as Alfred uses your `expert-kotlin` persona.
    - Watch as it runs `scripts/kotlin-loop.sh` to self-heal.
3.  **Sync**: `/moai:sync` to generate the docs.

## 🏆 Graduation

If you can successfully run this workflow, you are officially a **Kotlin Vibe Coder**.
You have extended MoAI-ADK to support a new language ecosystem entirely on your own.

**What's Next?**
- Add `lang-rust`?
- Add `lang-swift`?
The framework is yours to mold.
