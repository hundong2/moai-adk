# 🎓 Claude Code & MoAI-ADK Master Class

Welcome to the **MoAI-ADK Master Class**. This lecture series is designed to take you from a basic understanding of Claude Code to becoming an **Agentic Workflow Architect**.

You will learn how to build, orchestrate, and extend AI agents using the MoAI-ADK framework.
